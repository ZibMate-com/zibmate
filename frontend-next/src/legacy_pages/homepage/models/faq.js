    question: "What is Zibmate?",
    answer:
      "Zibmate is a platform that helps you discover PGs and shared accommodations you can trust. We focus on clarity, honest information, and direct connections — so you can find a place that actually feels right.",
  },
  {

    question: "Do I have to pay to use Zibmate?",
    answer: "No. Browsing PGs, viewing details, and requesting owner contact is completely free for tenants.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "How is Zibmate different from brokers or other platforms?",
    answer:
      "Unlike brokers, we don't push you toward a property, charge brokerage from tenants, or hide the owner. Unlike random listing sites, listings are reviewed over time, owners are encouraged to stay responsive, and you see real feedback from other tenants.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Are the PGs on Zibmate verified?",
    answer:
      "Many PGs are listed using publicly available information and tenant inputs. Owners can claim their PG to update details, respond to reviews, and keep information accurate. We clearly show when a PG is owner-claimed, responsive, or frequently contacted by tenants. Transparency matters more than fake '100% verified' tags.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Will my phone number be shared with PG owners?",
    answer: "Only when you request contact details or ask for a callback. We never sell or randomly share your number.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What if I don't like the PG after calling or visiting?",
    answer:
      "That's completely okay. Finding a home is personal. If one place doesn't work out, you can explore other PGs, compare options, and come back anytime. There's no pressure to book through Zibmate.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Can I leave a review for a PG?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your experience matters — good or bad. Reviews help other tenants make better decisions, help owners improve their PGs, and keep the platform honest.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "What if the information on a PG is incorrect?",
    answer:
      "You can flag it directly on the listing. We'll review it, notify the owner, and update the information if needed. Your feedback helps keep the platform reliable.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "My PG is already listed. Why?",
    answer:
      "Zibmate lists PGs to help tenants discover options easily. If your PG is listed, it means tenants are already searching for places like yours.",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "How do I control my PG listing?",
    answer:
      "Simply click 'Claim your PG'. Once claimed, you can update rent and availability, upload photos, set rules, and respond to tenant reviews. Claiming is free.",
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "Is Zibmate mandatory or exclusive?",
    answer:
      "No. You're free to list elsewhere, take tenants from any source, and use Zibmate only if it helps you. There's no lock-in.",
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "How does Zibmate make money?",
    answer:
      "Zibmate offers optional paid visibility and promotion tools to owners who want more exposure. Basic listing and control features remain free.",
